Shows decoratively overlapping image and text content.

== Description ==

Creates a section of content consisting of one or two images decoratively overlapping each other and accompanied by 
a card for text content like headings, paragraphs and call to action buttons. The block accomodates normal, wide, and full-page
width layouts. You can arrange the block's three elements (two images and one text), in four different sub-layouts. This allows for
better re-usability in different areas of your site.
